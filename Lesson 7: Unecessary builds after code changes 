if you change the code in the node js app, we have to rebuild the container every time 
    since the snapshot was taken with every time the container is created.
    if we rebuild the container, steps with copy and after are re done (like npm install) which is not good.


    what we do is split the copy statement,
    so final Dockerfile 

    FROM alpine:node 

    WORKDIR /usr/app

    COPY ./package.json ./
    RUN npm install
    COPY ./ ./ 

    CMD ["npm", "start"]
