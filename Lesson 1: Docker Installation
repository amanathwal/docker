Why use docker?

It makes it really easy to install and run new software without worrying about setup/dependencies.

What is a container?
Container is instance of an image. it is a program with its own space of hardware resources.


Docker has 
- Docker client(Docker CLI): tool we are going to issue commands to.
- Docker Server (Docker Daemon): tool that is responsible to create images, running containers etc.
