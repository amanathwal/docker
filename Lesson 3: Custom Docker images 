 =============================Custom Docker Images =============


      Docker File -> Docker Client -> Docker Server -> Usable Image


      Syntax for Docker File  :
      1. Specify a base image 
      2. Run Some commands to install additional programs 
            # with this step it creates a temporary container from image in step 1 and starts 
            # a temporary container and then this command was ran as primary instruction
            # and does its work, then the container is removed after taking a snapshot of its #current filesystem and save it as an image.
      3. Specify a command to run on container setup  
           # it looks at image from previous step and sets the primary command to this whenever 
           # you run and then shuts down that container
          

          example: run a docker file that runs redis-server

          1. Create a file and then a file Dockerfile (not extention)
          2. Here are the contents 
           
           # Use an existing docker image as a base 
           FROM alpine
            

           #Download and install a dependency 
           RUN apk add --update redis  # apk is package manmager that comes with alpine

           #tell the image what to do when it starts as  a container 
           CMD ["redis-server"]


           3. then run the command >>>  docker build .  
              # give the file to docker-cli , . is the context
             
           4.  copy the id and then run 
              docker run {id}

     In case we add more instructions to step 2 , it wont fetch the previous images again it will just use those from cache
