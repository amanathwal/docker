Any time some makes a request to a port on ur computer, you should forward it to 
container port.

Container make outgoing requests but this abilility is only for incoming request 

So we  change the runtime command:

docker run -p (incoming port):(container port) <image name>

example : 
   docker run -p 8080:8080 <image name>
