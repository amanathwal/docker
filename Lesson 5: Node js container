##### Create a Node JS app running in a container ###

1. Create a Node JS webapp

2. Create a Dockerfile  (name is exact without an extension)
    here is how the overall will be 

    find the base image from dockerhub

      1. From node:( version ) or node:alpine  # alpine tag means most stripped down installation
      2. RUN  npm install
      3. CMD['npm', 'start'] 


      but here package.json is not there  so here is the final dockerfile 
        COPY ./ (this path is relative to build context)  ./  (path in container)

   Final docker file 


      1. From node:( version ) or node:alpine  # alpine tag means most stripped down installation
      2. COPY ./ ./
      3. RUN  npm install
      4. CMD['npm', 'start'] 


      then run the command: docker build -t aman/testweb:latest  .
           :latest is optional


      4. then start the docker : 
          docker run   aman/testweb


          === to map it to particular directory in container ===
          Add WORKDIR instruction in the dockerfile 

          any following commands will run in the work dir

          example: WORKDIR /usr/app
          it will create a dir if it doesnot exist 
          and it should happen before COPY instruction before copy command
